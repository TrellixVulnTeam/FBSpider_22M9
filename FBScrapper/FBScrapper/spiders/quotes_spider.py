import scrapy

# name: identifies the Spider. It must be unique within a project, that is,
#     you canâ€™t set the same name for different Spiders.
#
# start_requests(): must return an iterable of Requests (
#     you can return a list of requests or write a generator function) which the Spider will
#     begin to crawl from. Subsequent requests will be generated successively from these
#     initial requests.
#
# parse(): a method that will be called to handle the response downloaded for each of the
#     requests made. The response parameter is an instance of TextResponse that holds the
#     page content and has further helpful methods to handle it.
#
# The parse() method usually parses the response, extracting the scraped data as dicts and
#     also finding new URLs to follow and creating new requests (Request) from them.
#
# Scrapy schedules the scrapy.Request objects returned by the start_requests method of the Spider.
#     Upon receiving a response for each one, it instantiates Response objects and calls the
#     callback method associated with the request (in this case, the parse method)
#     passing the response as argument.
